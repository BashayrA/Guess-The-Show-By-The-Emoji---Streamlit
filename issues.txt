There are some issues in the source_code that need a logic fixations
I might fix them later on.

  1. When running the webpage on the phone, it needs a double click on the Check button to view the answer. 
    One click will just change the set of the emojis, the session_state and even the value variable would not change at all.

  2. The game checks the values you entered as same as it is stored in the session_state, so if you write the name of the show correctly, you need to write it using lower case letters.
    otherwise, your answer are going to be evaluated wrong.

  3. When changing the category, a new set of emojis are going to show off on the screen. However, even if you get the show name right, 
    the show name meant for comparsion and evalute you answer is the last name appended to the session_state.

Otherwise, the game is so entertaining. I enjoyed coding it so much.
This was my first time using a python code to design a webpage to do a specific task. Regardless of the points of fixation, this is an 
opportunity to learn and practice to develop my coding skills more.
