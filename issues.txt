There is a single issue tied to the scoring base as it keeps 
counting the shows added to the st.session_state['show'] list
even when user changes the category from one to another.

a possible solution could be implemented by tracking the selected category
if any changes happened to it as a variable and 
it is possible using st.session_state['selected_category']

maybe starting a new count for every new category selection?

Otherwise, the game is so entertaining. I enjoyed coding it so much.
This was my first project using a python code to design a webpage to do a specific task. Regardless of the points of fixation, this is an 
opportunity to learn and practice to develop my coding skills more.
